This is just a little project I'm making to warm back up on my coding. I'll be trying to incorporate python, html, and a bit of css. Do what you will, though I'll be extremely surprised if anyone sees this project, as this is mainly on GitHub for a site, as a sort of wake-up call for me to get back into coding. If you could give me any suggestions or other comments for the site, it would be awesome to hear your guys advice.
